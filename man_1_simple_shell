.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
Our simple \chispun\ shell interprets and executes commands passed from standard input or from a relative path
 (./myls, for example) and can be used interactively and non-interactively.

.B Invocation
The first non-option argument specified on the command line will be treated as the name of a file from which to read commands 
(a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc.). Otherwise, 
the shell reads commands from its standard input.
