.TH HSH 0.1 "August 2021" "Holberton Colombia -Medellin" "Holberton Simple Shell"
.SH NAME
.B hsh
- command interpreter (simple shell).
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [filename]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
Our simple \chispun\ shell interprets and executes commands passed from standard input or from a relative path
 (./myls, for example) and can be used interactively and non-interactively.

.B Invocation
The first non-option argument specified on the command line will be treated as the name of a file from which to read commands 
(a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc.). Otherwise, 
the shell reads commands from its standard input.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables affect the execution of
.B sh
:

     ENV	Initialization file for interactive shells.

.SH EXIT STATUS

Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status.
If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted. Otherwise the shell will return the exit 
status of the last command executed, or if the
.B exit
builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B Mode  interactive
.br
$ ./hsh
#chispun$ pwd
.br
/mnt/c/Users/winda/kenialo/simple_shell
.br
#chispun$
.br
#chispun$ echo "man shell"
.br
man shell

.B Mode no interactive
.br
$ echo "pwd" | ./hsh
.br
/mnt/c/Users/winda/kenialo/simple_shell
.br
$ echo "man shell"
.br
man shell
.br
$

.SH BUGS
No known bugs until now.

If the function is found when searching for the command to execute in the different directories of the $PATH, its output status becomes
the shell's output status. If, on the other hand, the function is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an output
status of 127 (which can be checked with '$?').
